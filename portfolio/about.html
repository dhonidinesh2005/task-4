    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Dhoni Dinesh</strong>. I am currently pursuing my studies at <strong>Teerthanker Mahaveer University</strong>, and I proudly hail from the coastal city of <strong>Visakhapatnam</strong>. Ever since I was introduced to computers, I've been deeply fascinated by how websites and software applications work behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about both front-end and back-end web development, and I enjoy the creative process of designing clean, intuitive interfaces as well as building efficient back-end architectures. My technical proficiency includes technologies such as <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>.</p>
    <p>In addition to web development, I have expanded my skills to include <strong>Python</strong>, which I use for automation, data analysis, and building machine learning models. I am also proficient in working with <strong>SQL</strong> and relational databases, which are essential for managing and querying large datasets in various applications.</p>
    <p>My experience with databases has enabled me to work with both <strong>SQL</strong> databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, to design efficient data storage solutions that are scalable and reliable. I have also utilized cloud-based databases for improved scalability in certain projects.</p>
    <p>To support my development work, I also use industry-standard tools such as <strong>Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, Postman</strong>, and <strong>Figma</strong>. I continuously strive to stay updated with new tools and trends, which helps me grow as a developer.</p>
    <p>In addition to my coding abilities, I have a growing interest in UI/UX design and believe that understanding user behavior is crucial for building impactful products. My journey in tech so far has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited for what lies ahead as I continue to build and create.</p>
