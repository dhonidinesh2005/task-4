      <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
      <p>A multi-page responsive site showcasing my skills and work using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      <p class="blog">Creating this portfolio was a rewarding experience as it allowed me to express both my technical and creative sides. I focused on responsive design principles and structured navigation to ensure accessibility across devices. It was moderately challenging to align design consistency across pages, but it improved my frontend development discipline significantly.</p>

      <h2>To-Do App</h2>
      <p>A simple web app that allows users to manage tasks, with persistent storage via localStorage.</p>
      <p class="blog">This project helped me understand how to work with the browser's local storage API. I implemented features like task creation, deletion, and real-time persistence. It was relatively simple at first but required careful planning to handle dynamic DOM updates. The most complex part was ensuring data consistency after multiple user actions without a backend server.</p>

      <h2>Product Listing Page</h2>
      <p>A dynamic product interface where users can filter and sort products by category, price, and rating.</p>
      <p class="blog">This was the most technically demanding of the three projects. It required setting up a dynamic UI where user-selected filters would change the content shown on the page. I wrote JavaScript functions for sorting, filtering, and rendering the items efficiently. Debugging logic for combinations of filters and ensuring a smooth user experience was the biggest challenge but highly educational.</p>
